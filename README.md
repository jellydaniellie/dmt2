<a name="introduction"></a>Introduction
---------------------------------------

The repository contains content for CS3120 - Discrete Math and Theory 2 at [the University of Virginia](https://virginia.edu).

<a name="description"></a>Course Description
--------------------------------------------

The goal of this course is to understand the fundamental limits on what can be efficiently computed. These limits reveal properties about information, communication, and computing, as well as practical issues about how to solve problems. Introduces computation theory including grammars, automata, and Turing machines.

<a name="headtas"></a>Instructor and Head TAs
------------------------------------------

We have one instructor and multiple **Head TAs** for this course. Their names and emails are shown in the table below. Each head TA is responsible for a specific category (e.g., grading, office hours, etc.). Students should always **contact the relevant head ta first**, as the primary point of contact regarding issues in each category. Instructors are often slow at responding and the head TAs can more quickly address your concern or escalate the situation to an instructor if necessary.

### Instructors / Head TAs

<a name="officehours"></a>Office Hours Description and Schedule
------------------------------------------

Office hours are held in various locations throughout the week and are of varying type. Information can be found below. There are two possible locations for office hours:

- **In-Person OH**: Some OH will be held in-person (in Thornton Stacks). See the chart below for details. These will function as *traditional* office hours.

- **Online (Discord) OH**: Some OH will be held on our **Discord Server**. To attend office hours, simply join the office hours queue voice channel and you will be added to the office hours queue. When you are taken off the queue you will be automatically moved to a staging room to wait (it is called *oh-up-next* or similar). Soon after, a TA will manually pull you off that staging room into their office hours to help you.

- **Group OH**: These are weekly discussion sections where a TA will answer general questions regarding homeworks, quizzes, algorithm intution, etc. to larger groups of attendees.
