The syllabus for the course can be found [here](./syllabus.pdf). Most (but not all) of that information is summarized here.

<a name="lectures"></a>Lectures

Lectures will be held in-person in the classroom listed on the University Registrar. Lectures will be recorded for the convenience of those who cannot intend or prefer not to for any reason.

<a name="textbook"></a>Textbook
------------------------------------------

You will really need to read and study material other than the slides. There are many choices where you can get more details about our topics, but a textbook is the easiest option.

Weâ€™ll post readings from the following textbook, and we urge you to read them or get that info from another source.

*Introduction to the Theory of Computation* by Michael Sipser, 2nd edition.


<a name="lectures"></a>Modules / Exams
------------------------------------------

The course is divided into **7 modules**, each which lasts for about 2-3 weeks each. The 7 modules are listed below:

- **Module 1: What is a computer?**
- **Module 2: Review of Proof Techniques** 
- **Module 3: Set Cardinality / Infinite Sets**
- **Module 4: Regular Languages** 
- **Module 5: Context-Free Grammars** 
- **Module 6: Turing Machines** 
- **Module 7: Complexity Theory**

We will have two midterm exams in the course. These will be traditional midterm exams. The current dates for these exams are:

- **Midterm 1:** Thu. Oct. 12
- **Midterm 2:** Thu. Nov. 16

These dates are subject to change.

There are **one or two homework assignments per module (depending on the module)**, that must be completed. These will be graded on a traditional scale (out of 10 points). See the syllabus and the homeworks page for more details.

<a name="lettergrades"></a>Final Letter Grades
----------------------------------------------------------

Your letter grade will be calculated using a traditional weighted average. The weights are:

- **Homework:** 30 percent
- **Midterms:** 40 percent (20 percent each)
- **Final Exam:** 30 percent

Your final letter grade will be determined by the traditional decade curve. The table for which is shown below:

| Letter Grade | Percentage Average |
|:--------------:|:---:|
| F | 0 |
| D- | 60 |
| D | 63 |
| D+ | 67 |
| C- | 70 |
| C | 73 |
| C+ | 77 |
| B- | 80 |
| B | 83 |
| B+ | 87 |
| A- | 90 |
| A | 93 |
| A+ | 99 |
